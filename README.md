# Decoding the Indus Script through Sound Frequencies  

## Overview  
This repository presents a novel approach to interpreting the undeciphered Indus Valley seals and inscriptions. Instead of assuming the signs represent written words in the traditional sense, this research explores the possibility that the symbols encode **sound frequencies, tones, and vibrations**.  

By mapping symbols to frequency ranges (Hz) and comparing these with natural resonances (human voice, instruments, architectural acoustics), we propose that the Indus script functioned as both a spiritual and communicative system.

## Methodology  
1. **Symbol Selection**  
   - Randomly chosen seals and inscriptions were analyzed.  
   - Repeated symbols were catalogued to detect patterns.  

2. **Frequency Mapping**  
   - Each symbol was assigned a corresponding frequency.  
   - The mapping was cross-checked against the 7 fundamental tones (Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si).  

3. **Phrase Construction**  
   - Inscriptions were “read” as tonal sequences.  
   - These tonal patterns were then matched with linguistic equivalents.  

4. **Cross-Language Verification**  
   - The tonal meaning was tested in multiple languages (Hungarian, English, Spanish, etc.).  
   - Results showed consistent translations across different languages, suggesting a universal symbolic system.

## Example Translation  
An analyzed seal showed the following sequence:  

- Symbol A → Tone: Do → Word: “Beginning / Foundation”  
- Symbol B → Tone: Fa → Word: “Prayer / Call”  
- Symbol C → Tone: Sol → Word: “Divine / To the Sky”  

**Resulting Translation:**  
“Lina sits and begins to pray to the Divine.”  

This matches known cultural practices of the Indus Valley (rituals, prayers, offerings).

## Cultural Context  
Archaeological evidence suggests that the Indus civilization:  
- Practiced ritual bathing and purification.  
- Used fire and water altars in ceremonies.  
- Honored fertility, nature, and cosmic order.  

The frequency-based interpretations align with these practices, reinforcing the hypothesis that the script was spiritual in nature.

## Multi-Language Consistency  
One of the most striking discoveries:  
- The **same seal** produced nearly identical meanings when “read” through tonal mapping in **different languages**.  
- This suggests the Indus system was **not tied to one spoken language**, but instead encoded **universal sound-symbol correspondences**.  

**Example:**  
- Hungarian: “Kezdés – Ima – Ég” (Beginning – Prayer – Sky)  
- English: “Beginning – Prayer – Divine”  
- Spanish: “Comienzo – Oración – Cielo”  

All point to the same core idea.  

---

## Conclusion  
This research introduces a **testable, reproducible hypothesis**:  
The Indus script may encode **sound frequencies** rather than words, functioning as a vibrational-spiritual notation system.  

We encourage linguists, archaeologists, and acoustic engineers to test and expand upon this model.
