# Decoding the Indus Script through Sound Frequencies

Overview

This repository presents a novel approach to interpreting the undeciphered Indus Valley seals and inscriptions. Instead of assuming the signs represent written words in the traditional sense, this research explores the possibility that the symbols encode sound frequencies and vibrational patterns.

Our analysis suggests that certain recurring Indus symbols may correspond to fundamental tones (similar to the seven base notes identified in ancient Egyptian culture). By mapping these signs to sound frequencies, we uncovered consistent and meaningful phrases across multiple seals, indicating possible religious or ritualistic content.

Key Findings

Indus symbols may represent vibrational frequencies rather than purely phonetic characters.

Cross-analysis of multiple seals shows consistent meanings: invocations, prayers, or dedications.

Decoded sequences often align with the Indus cultureâ€™s known focus on ritual purity, offerings, and divine order.

The method works across different languages
